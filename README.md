### - Design

I'm trying to make an app for managing portfolio, so that user can login with their github account and add project to their portfolio.

### Deployment

- Rails for backend
- React for front end

### Tect

- p5.js for loading screen
- nokogiri for parse website metadata
- material-ui and bootstrap for design

### Known Issues

- The app can only add projects, but not edit or delete projects
- Use get request to add entry to the data base
